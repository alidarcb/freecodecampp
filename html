  <h1>Fritz Zwicky</h1>

  <p>Fritz Zwicky was a man of science, he, along with a colleague, named supernovas, theorized the origin of cosmic rays, and he thought of the dark matter before anyone else did. I'm sure most of us have heard througout lives of his discoveries in our education, but not so much about his name. I recently watched the Cosmos show with Neil De Grasse Tyson where he explains a bit of the dark matter and since Zwicky's name isn't popular -I mean outside of the science field-, I thought of writing about him even if just a bit. </p>

      <h2>Some of his work</h2>
      <p>Some of his work includes:
        <ul>
          <li>Supernovae and neutron stars</li>
          <li>Gravitational lenses</li>
          <li>Dark matter</li>
          <li>Tired light</li>
      </ul>
      Zwicky had an original mind, and many of his ideas were rejected at first and later when discovered they'd remember his name.</p>
